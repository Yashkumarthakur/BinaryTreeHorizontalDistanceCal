Binary Tree Test


Binary Tree Operations

1. insert 
2. check distance of nodes 
 
1
Enter integer element to insert : 

9
Inserted as root node : 9
Type 'y' to exit OR continue to enter numbers 

7
Inserted 7 to left of Node 9
Type 'y' to exit OR continue to enter numbers 

15
Inserted 15 to right of Node 9
Type 'y' to exit OR continue to enter numbers 

5
Inserted 5 to left of Node 7
Type 'y' to exit OR continue to enter numbers 

8

Binary Tree Operations

1. insert 
2. check distance of nodes 
 
2
Choose from 1 to 4, level to calculate distance of 2 nodes : 

4
1  12  25  
Enter first node
1

Enter second node
25
1  12  25  Distance is :6
Distance :6


Do you want to continue (Type y or n)
